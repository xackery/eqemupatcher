1962 As a Priest of Love, loyal cleric of Erollisi, it is you that the people of Freeport look to for comfort and healing within the sanctuary that is the Temple of Marr.

1980 The Ashen Order, under the guidance of Puab Closk, sits in the eye of the storm that is Freeport.

1984 Thus you are not quite a welcomed citizen of Qeynos.  As you ply your trade and ally yourself with the Circle of the Unseen Hand you will soon garner the attention of the Qeynos Guard and be forced to move about the city more discreetly and preferably under the cloak of darkness.

1987 Working with the Coalition of Tradesfolk, as Freeport's Thieves Guild is called, you are free to ply your trade where you see fit.  It is best for you to steer clear of North Freeport though.  It seems the Knights of Truth have little patience for thieves

1995 Long before you were hatched, your path was chosen for you by the Hierophants of Cabilis.  Now that you have reached the appropriate season of your long life it is time for you to abandon the innocence of a broodling and report for duty as a new recruit within the Legion of Cabilis.  Under the tutorage of the Drill Masters you shall become a great warrior.  You shall protect your people with pride for there are many dangers within the untamed lands of Kunark as well as the rumor of the arrival of adventurers from abroad.  As a member of the once great Iksar Empire you are aware of the hatred and fear other races have of you.  Only within Cabilis are you truly safe.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
1996 Welcome to Cabilis, the new capital of the reborn Iksar Empire.  Cabilis, or New Sebilis as some call it, is a great walled city which lies deep in the heart of the continent of Kunark.  
1997 Long before you were hatched the Hierophants of Cabilis detected the spark of strength and wisdom within you. It was then that your path was chosen for you.  Now that you have approached the season of rebirth, it is time to abandon your life and journey to the Temple of Terror to begin your training in the brotherhood of the Crusaders of Greenmist, shadowknights of Cabilis.  There you shall learn the ways of torture and discipline under the direction of the Lords of Pain.  You shall prepare yourself for the crusades to come.  Know that all other nations fear you.

Having reached the season of rebirth you have been summoned to the Temple of Terror.  It is there that you shall study the ways of the unholy shaman known as the Scaled Mystics.  Through the Hierophants, ancient Iksar ancestors shall guide you through the stages of the Scaled Mystics so that one day you may become a vessel of great power.  Together with the Crusaders of Greenmist you form the religious backbone of the Iksar empire.  The Iksar Legion does not act without the aid of the Scaled Mystics.  Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear and dislike the Iksar and cannot be trusted.  Only within Cabilis are you truly safe.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2000 Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected the mana surging within your life force and thus your path was chosen for you.  Now that you have reached the season of rebirth you have been summoned to the infamous Tower of Death.  It is there that you shall be introduced to the dark circle of magic known as necromancy. The scholars of the temple shall welcome you into the Brood of Kotiz to begin your studies.  Most Iksar residents fear and respect the Brood of Kotiz.  The rumors of experiments performed on fellow Iksar run rampant.  All other Iksar castes have respect for the Brood.  Beware of other races as well as outsiders from abroad.  They have no love for the Iksar.  It is only within Cabilis that you are truly safe.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2001 Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis foresaw your inner strength.  It was then that your path was chosen for you.  Now that you have reached the season of rebirth you have been summoned to the Court of Pain, training grounds and temple of the Swifttail Caste.   There you shall learn the ancient combat arts of  the monk. Through discipline and sacrifice your body, mind and soul shall be forged into a weapon.  Being an Iksar you know that your race stands alone and allies are few and not to be trusted.  It is only within the city of Cabilis that you are truly safe.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2002 Before your hatching, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected the strength of your rage and the wisdom of your instincts. It was then that your fate was decided.  You were taken outside the walls of Cabilis at the time of your rebirth and sent to live among and dominate the beasts of the wild lands of Kunark. You learned to fight as the beasts do, with tooth, tail, and claw. Like the Scaled Mystics, your devotion to Cazic Thule allows you to contact the spirit realm but while the Scaled Mystics are guided and aided by the spirits of the ancient Iksar, you subjugate the animal spirits to magically aid you and your companions. Many Iksar beastlords serve the Legion of Cabilis as scouts. Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear and dislike the Iksar and cannot be trusted.

2003 The life of a Troll warrior is dangerous indeed.  They have a loosely unified guild that is known as Da Bashers but they almost seem as likely to attack someone within their own guild as they do a sworn enemy.

Like the Dark Ones, you harness the power of your deity to enslave the spirits of the wild and force them to magically aid you and your companions.

2008 An ogre warrior is second to none when it comes down to brute strength and they take great pride in that.  They also take pride in how many Dwarf Pickles they can scarf down in a minute.  The Craknek Warriors are the oldest guild in Oggok.  They maintain their strength and reputation through constantly warring with other factions.  At times, they will even turn their aggression on members of their own race.  This has led to distrust between the Craknek Warriors and the Greenblood Knights.

3239 The hardy race of Barbarians, or Northmen, use their wisdom and formidable brawn to defend honor and justice.  Their magnificent stature is a sight to behold; even more so when it is unleashed in battle.  Barbarians are one of the tallest races to walk the lands of Norrath.<BR><BR>As a tribal culture, Barbarians are a little rough around the edges when it comes to interactions with other races.  Even the Barbarians' mannerisms and features have a rugged quality.  <BR><BR>The Barbarians consider themselves superior to other inhabitants of Norrath, particularly the Teir`Dal and Erudites, which are viewed as pathetically weak.  Barbarians have a special place in their hearts for the Dwarves of Kaladim whom they view as steadfast and brave.  The high quality of Dwarven mead may also have some influence on the cordial relationship between the two races.  Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves, and the other evil races are hated, as they directly oppose the Barbarians' sense of justice.  <BR><BR>Barbarians live in the frigid city of Halas, nestled amidst the icy peaks of Everfrost in Northern Antonica.  The city is rather rudimentary, but serves the needs of the Barbarians that call it home.
3240 The Teir`Dal, or Dark Elves, are a twisted reflection of the Elves of light, but are just as lithe and intelligent as their cousins.  Their features are often soft and delicate, though the eyes of the Dark Elves betray their darker inclinations.  The Dark Elves' skin ranges from blue tones to black and their hair is most often white with some variances.  They reach a height of about 5 feet tall.<BR><BR>Innoruuk, Lord of Hate, created the Teir`Dal and his hatred flows through their veins and moves their black hearts.  It runs so deep that the Teir`Dal hate all, including their own kind and their creator.  <BR><BR>The Dark Elves view all other races as inferior; tools to be used for their own evil manipulations.  Most races fear the Dark Elves.  The Teir`Dal would desire the fall of the rest of the Elven world, leaving them broken, eradicated, or enslaved.  Though viewed as inferior and dimwitted, Trolls and Ogres are tolerated as they are useful in the Teir`Dal plans for conquest.<BR><BR>There is a labyrinth of evil under the Nektulos Forest called Neriak, the home city of the Dark Elves.  Its entrance is deep within gloomy shadows of the woods.
3241 Though made lower to the ground than most races, the Dwarves created by Brell Serilis burst with pride and determination.  The stout and sturdy Dwarves are extremely strong, making them one of the best-suited to endure long and intense battles.  Dwarves have broad faces, usually with a prominent nose, and take extraordinary pride in their hair.  Males often take great care to grow long beards and moustaches and females often tie their hair up in a bun.  Some females also sport a finely trimmed beard.<BR><BR>This ancient race is strongly motivated by honor and loyalty.  They also know how to balance work and play, and know how to tell a good story.  If a Dwarf is ever wronged, it can be painful for the wrongdoer as Dwarves tend to hold a grudge.  <BR><BR>Dwarves can be somewhat abrasive, but find friendship easiest with the Barbarians, Humans, Gnomes, and Halflings.  The Dwarves tolerate the Elves of light, but they despise the Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, and other evil races.  <BR><BR>Built within the Butcherblock Mountains and amidst a series of mines, the stronghold of Kaladim houses the Dwarven race and royalty.
3242 The Erudites trace their ancestry back to the great mage, Erud, who led them to Odus.  They are descendents of the original humans on Norrath and inherited the best of human intelligence.  Their extraordinary acumen came at the price of thinner, more delicate bodies.  Erudites reach about six feet tall, with some of that height attributed to their high foreheads.  <BR><BR>Unique accomplishments with magic and study have understandably led the Erudites to believe that they are the most intellectually superior race on Norrath.  They are known for their serious demeanor.<BR><BR>Most Erudites spend their days absorbed in books and tomes, or magical contemplation, and they typically do not involve themselves in matters that do not directly affect them.  They often pay no regard to anyone that hasn't achieved intellectual accomplishment.  That in mind, Erudites do not associate with the evil races.  Even the Erudite Heretics of Paineel are not fond of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls.<BR><BR>The Erudites live in two areas on the continent of Odus near the Toxxulia Forest.  One city, housing the purer of heart, is called Erudin--an ornate city gleaming with polished marble and babbling fountains.   Paineel is the home of the rebellious Erudite Heretics who were banished from the city for delving into the forbidden realm of dark magic.
3243 The mixing of Elf and Human is a common tale.  Many stories of romance between these two races can be heard around Norrath.  As a result, Half Elves are taller than their Elven ancestors and carry some of the strength of their human bloodlines.  They have slightly harsher features than Elves, but the mix still makes them pleasant to lay eyes on.  <BR><BR>Unfortunately, the children of these forbidden romances are often shunned, becoming victims of prejudice by Humans and Elves alike.  Most Half Elves are unaffected by the discrimination and retain a pleasant manner.  Usually Half Elves will develop a very close and trusted group of friends that act as a surrogate family.  <BR><BR>The difficult lives of the Half Elves, and their lack of ties to any one place makes them adept travelers of the world and exceptional friends and storytellers.  Sadly, some Half Elves become embittered by the constant difficulty of finding a place in the world and choose a path of thievery.  The Half Elves are on amicable terms with most races in Norrath, but have no affection for the evil races.  <BR><BR>While Half Elves can be seen in many areas of the world, they are primarily found in the Wood Elf city of Kelethin and within the Surefall Glade.
3244 Halflings are aptly named, as they are half the size of the average height for most of Norrath's races.  They usually measure about three feet in height and are often thick around their middles.  Their lack of height is not be confused as a weakness though; if confronted or threatened, Halflings are very capable.<BR><BR>Halflings are happy-go-lucky and hospitable.  Any one of them would readily give their life for a friend.  They are renowned for their tomfoolery and humor, always appreciating a bit of fun.  They especially like to tease Erudites for their lack of wit.  Enjoying what each day brings is a large part of their lives.  <BR><BR>Halflings tend to get along well with most races, except those that are truly evil, but even then rare friendships are made with members of the less savory races.  <BR><BR>The quaint, stunted city of Rivervale lies between the Kithicor Forest and Misty Thicket in central Antonica.  It is crowded with skilled tradesman, taverns, and friendly folk.
3245 The High Elves, also known as the Koada`Dal, are regarded as the closest relatives of the original Norrathian Elves created by Tunare, Mother of All.  These noble creatures stand tall with ivory skin and gentle features.  They are certainly not the most sturdy of races, but make up for that with heart.  Throughout the ages, they have stood for freedom and justice, fighting evil with powerful magic and their skills with the blade.  <BR><BR>The High Elves are known for their civilized conduct and, as such, are perceived as a race rather full of their own importance, though they are quite benevolent.  They expect to be treated with respect and do have an haughty pride about them.  As a result, it is difficult to make friends with a High Elf.<BR><BR>The High Elves feel their cousins, the Wood Elves, are to be sought out as loyal servants.  This noble race views Humans, Gnomes, and Halflings as worthy of their presence.  Dwarves, Barbarians, and Erudites, however, are simply endured.  The High Elves expend little effort to help them.  The evil races are looked upon with contempt and will be dispatched when opportunity presents itself.<BR><BR>The home of the High Elves is within the magnificent and pristine architecture of the city of Felwithe.  The structures crafted behind the walls make the beauty of the surrounding forests pale.  The city lies within the Greater Faydark on the continent of Faydwer.
3246 The strength of the Human race lies in its diversity of thought, belief, and profession; though they tend be weaker than many other races.  They have no particular specialty with the sword or arcane magic.  While that is true, Humans are cunning and possess great ingenuity, which gives them an advantage.  The Human mind is sharp enough to adapt to nearly all forms of study and this gives them a great range of options when choosing a profession.  <BR><BR>Humans often divide themselves with their own squabbles, but they will always return to their brother's side in times of crisis, or to protect a mutual interest.  <BR><BR>Humans generally get along well with most good and neutral races, depending on their beliefs and the path of their profession.  Humans are not so friendly toward Trolls, Ogres, and other evil races.  Dark Elves are tolerated within Freeport, but they tend to be mistrusted, even feared.  <BR><BR>The port cities of Qeynos and Freeport lie on opposite coasts of Antonica, and are the most common homes for the Humans.  These two cities are the center of Human activity, although this race can be found wandering on virtually every continent of Norrath and beyond.
3247 The fearsome and savage reptilian race on Norrath is known as the Iksar.  With their significant height, scales, and long tails, Iksar are intimidating in their appearance.  However, their reptilian physiology grants them a natural affinity for water, as well as enhanced regeneration.<BR><BR>Their entire civilization developed in isolation for centuries and fostered an unusual culture.  The Iksar are a tribal race with a very simple social structure.  Allies to no one, the Iksar are intelligent and proud.  Having seen their race crumble through the toils of war, the race has become bitter about its loss of power.  After being slaves and warring with the Ring of Scale, they were nearly made extinct.<BR><BR>The Iksar depend only on their god and creator, Cazic Thule.  Iksar are unwelcome in all known cities of Norrath.  Iksar are not too fond of any of the races in Norrath.<BR><BR>The Iksar live in the ancient city of Cabilis, on Kunark near the Lake of Ill Omen.  It is a dark place with a maze of canals, which the Iksar use for travel around their city.
3248 With their lumbering gait and enormous breadth, Ogres are an ominous presence.  Created by Rallos Zek, these massive creatures are feared in battle for their raw strength and uncanny endurance.  While not very intelligent, Ogres are known to cooperate with one another quite efficiently.  <BR><BR>The Ogres have a twisted sense of duty that could easily be mistaken for stupidity.  They are, justifiably, quite single-minded.  Their thick skulls also give them a  high level of resistance to being stunned in battle.<BR><BR>Ogres have been known to be cannibalistic, but are more partial to eating Humans, Erudites, and High Elves.  Nearly all of the good and neutral races avoid them out of self-preservation.  Ogres have learned to work with the Trolls, but have no love for them, and they fear Dark Elves.  <BR><BR>The crude tunneled city of Oggok lies within the Feerrott, a jungle-like area bordering the Innothule Swamp and Rathe Mountains in southern Antonica.  The home city for the Ogres is a fairly slow-paced civilization that focuses on battle training and magic to give them an upper hand in battle.
3249 Trolls are often considered a hideous and deplorable race that carries a sickening smell.  This view suits the Troll as they are generally unpleasant to everyone.  Trolls are an immense race, at least twice as strong as the average human.  They have the ability to regenerate faster than most other races.  Trolls have two primary motivators: food and power.  These grotesque creatures will eat just about anything.  <BR><BR>Trolls are extremely cruel and their greed is almost insatiable.  Trolls also fancy they have advanced abilities in the culinary arts, with their ability to pickle just about anything, or make a meal out of "spare parts."<BR><BR>Trolls generally detest and distrust the other races and even their own kind.  They tend to put up with the Dark Elves out of fear, much like Ogres do.  <BR><BR> Very recently, in a historic battle led by Warlord Ykesha, the Trolls triumphed and took back their city of Grobb from the Frogloks in the Innothule Swamp of Antonica.

3273 The Vah Shir are a regal feline race that walk upright.  They were once the ruling class of other similar cat-like races on Odus.  Since being translocated onto an alien moon by a collision of Erudite magic, they learned to survive and became stronger.  Vah Shir are as tall as Barbarians and display a variety of different markings on their fur, based on their lineage.  In spite of their height, they are very agile and graceful.  They are known for their integrity and the destructive feral power they bring down on their enemies.  <BR><BR>Vah Shir follow no particular religion, but they do pay homage to their king, Raja Kerrath.  Because of the adversity they have faced, the Vah Shir share a tight bond with one another and are extremely loyal to kin.  The Vah Shir are selfless and focus on the good of all rather than their individual needs.  <BR><BR>Because the Vah Shir are not exposed to the daily struggles in Norrath, they are indifferent to the various races of Norrath.<BR><BR>Shar Vahl is the majestic den of the Vah Shir.  The city was built high above Norrath, on the moon known as Luclin.  The city is located between the Hollowshade Moor and Shadeweaver's Thicket.
3274 The Wood Elves, or Feir`Dal, are more accepting of others than their cousins, the High Elves.  Like their Elven cousins, Wood Elves only reach about five feet in height and have very attractive and subtle features.  Their skins are tinged an oaken color so that they blend with their natural surroundings in the forests.  <BR><BR>Wood Elves generally regard those who respect nature as friends, especially rangers and druids.  The Wood Elves believe in co-existing with their natural surroundings as opposed to shaping them.  This leads most of their kind to worship Tunare, the Mother of All.  The Feir`Dal harness the powers of song and the living, breathing properties of their environment.  Wood Elves are known for their love of celebration and good food.  A good song will also tweak their pointed ears.<BR><BR>Wood Elves get along well with most good and neutral races, and merely dislike most evil races.  They hold great malice toward the Dark Elves--an aberration of their ancestors--as well as their allies.<BR><BR>The Feir`Dal are at home in the trees in their intricate city of Kelethin, which hangs high above the ground between the trunks and branches of the Greater Faydark.  Comprised of platforms and suspension bridges, Kelethin is both well defended and beautiful.

3316 The Frogloks are a race of sentient amphibians.  While they may be short, Frogloks are sturdy.  They can swim underwater for long distances and can see well in the dark.  They are clumsy on land as they are required to hop, but they can cross great distances with each leap.<BR><BR>Frogloks willingly die to defend truth, justice, and honor.  In the recent past, Mithaniel Marr chose the Frogloks to perform some of his tasks on Norrath and enlightened them as a reward for their accomplishments.  The valor bestowed upon them and their eagerness to serve their god is admirable.<BR><BR>The Frogloks harbor disdain for all that is evil.  They have a tolerance for the Humans and share a rapport with the Northmen.  Other good and neutral races are well liked and viewed as allies that share a common enemy.<BR><BR>The Frogloks have been forced out of their first home within the Innothule Swamp of Antonica by the Trolls and have found a new home, the Outpost of Gukta, in Rathe Mountains.
3317 Bards are jack-of-all-trades adventurers who use music to create a wide variety of magical effects. Though they often use melee weapons, bards are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear plate armor and wield many different types of weapons and instruments.<BR><BR>Bards can do a little bit of everything. Their songs can regenerate health and mana, increase attack speed and accuracy, momentarily charm angry enemies, help friends resist many types of damage and even directly damage enemies. Bards are perhaps best known, however, for their ability to greatly increase the foot speed of their group.<BR><BR>Bards have the unique ability to create multiple effects at once. By weaving different songs together, a bard can customize effects to any situation. This makes nimble fingers and quick thinking a must for those who want to play a bard.<BR><BR>Bards do well both alone and in groups. With the right combination of songs, they can adapt to many different challenges. The bard is a great class for players who enjoy a wide variety of play options but are quick to adapt to a changing situation.
3318 Beastlords are the masters of raw nature, who focus this energy into themselves and their warder pets. Beastlords are primarily a melee class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons, or use their bare hands to attack.<BR><BR>Beastlords prepare for battle by calling on their animal warder and increasing the creature's natural abilities with spells. Beastlords share every battle with their warders, fighting along side these fierce companions or falling back to heal and aid.<BR><BR>Beastlords also gain spells to slow or damage their opponents. Beastlords can heal and add to an ally's health and mana regeneration as well, making them a well-rounded ally in battle.<BR><BR>Beastlords can adventure solo well in many places. They depend upon coordination with their warders and well planned spells to finish every fight, but they can also aid a group through their spells and melee abilities. The beastlord is a great class for players who like the option of solo melee fights, but want to be able to help in a group.
3319 Clerics dedicate their lives to the gods of Norrath, gaining magical powers in exchange for their faith and service. Clerics are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear plate armor and wield blunt weapons.<BR><BR>Clerics gain powerful healing and enhancement spells, greatly increasing the health and defenses of their group, while keeping them healed in the most dangerous battles. While other priest classes have healing spells, no one can match up with the power and efficiency of clerical healing.<BR><BR>Clerics are potent enemies of the undead, able to channel their holy fervor into highly destructive banishment spells. Resurrection is also the domain of the cleric, allowing them to bring their fallen companions back from the dead without the normal penalties for death.<BR><BR>With a few exceptions, clerics are dependent on being part of a group. But they are highly desirable group members. An experienced cleric is a great benefit to any group and is an excellent choice for the social player.
3320 Druids are disciples of the wilds, following the teachings of the Norrathian gods of nature. Druids are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear leather armor and wield blunt weapons and scimitars.<BR><BR>Druidic magic takes many forms, allowing the druid to fill a wide variety of roles when in a group or adventuring alone. Druids possess excellent healing abilities, powerful mana and health regenerative spells, and valuable enhancements that improve the health and armor of their group.<BR><BR>Offensively, druids are both powerful and versatile. They have access to fire and cold-based damage spells, a selection of disease and swarm spells that damage their enemies over time, and devastating banishment spells focused upon unnaturally summoned creatures. Druids also gain some of the best travel spells, including the ability to speed up their group's movement and teleport their group to distant regions.<BR><BR>Druids are a well-rounded class, prospering in both solo and grouped situations. An experienced druid is able to adventure alone, but is equally at home in a group. The druid is an excellent class for players who enjoy a variety of play styles and options.
3321 Enchanters are the most subtle of spell casters, with little focus on doing damage directly but tremendous impact on the world around them. Enchanters are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Enchanters specialize on improving the minds of their allies, with unmatched mana regeneration spells and mental enhancements. Haste spells are also the domain of the enchanter, providing incredible boosts in attack speed for members of their group. Enchanters have many powers of illusion as well, allowing them to take the form of many different creatures and races.<BR><BR>In battle, enchanters are able to bring order to chaotic situations, often saving their group in a fight that would otherwise be lost. Enchanters possess the ability to mesmerize their enemies, temporarily removing them from a battle. Attack slowing spells are also a specialty, dramatically lowering the speed of a monster's attacks for a period of time. In many situations, enchanters can call upon powerful charm spells to subjugate the mind of a monster and command it to do the enchanter's bidding. <BR><BR>Enchanters are a powerful class, but often rely upon a group to reach their full potential. Experienced enchanters thrive in chaotic situations where they can make the most of their offensive abilities. The enchanter is a good choice for players who enjoy playing in groups and like to take charge of challenging situations.
3322 Magicians are master summoners, able to call elemental pets to do their bidding and to conjure useful items from thin air. Magicians are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Elemental pets are at the heart of a magician's offensive strategy, and typically accompany a magician in all his adventures. This pet provides protection for its master, along with powerful attacks and special abilities. Magicians have a large selection of fire and magic-based damage spells, allowing them to mount a damaging magical assault in support of their elemental pet.<BR><BR>Magicians have a wide range of summoning spells, allowing them to conjure such diverse items as food, weapons, armor, and magical jewelry. In battle, the magician can encase his entire group in a shield of fire, damaging any opponent that strikes them. Magicians also have spells that lower a monster's resistance to magic, allowing spells to damage them more easily.<BR><BR>Magicians are a very focused class, sacrificing some diversity for power in their area of expertise. Magicians are able to adventure solo, but also provide value in a group situation. The magician is a good choice for players who enjoy managing a powerful pet and using a tightly focused spell selection.
3323 Monks devote their energies to the pursuit of physical perfection, shaping their very bodies into deadly machines. Monks are a melee class with the ability to wear leather armor, wield blunt weapons, and use unarmed combat styles.<BR><BR>Monks forego heavy armor and almost all weapons in order to hone themselves into masters of combat, using their fists and a stout staff to make their mark upon Norrath. Monks learn many special attacks to enhance their damage dealing abilities, including the dragon punch and the legendary flying kick.<BR><BR>In their martial studies monks also learn other useful skills, including the ability to move silently and fall safely from great heights. Experienced monks also learn to feign death, slowing their body's functions enough to fool most observers into believing them dead -- this trick often allows the monk to escape dangerous situations as monsters wander off, thinking the monk defeated.<BR><BR>Monks are a specialist class, focusing on physical combat to the exclusion of all else. Monks provide a powerful ally in a group, though it's not unusual to see a monk adventuring alone. The monk is a good choice for players who enjoy a strong offensive role in combat and leading groups in their dungeon adventures.
3324 Necromancers are servants of the dark gods, studying ancient and mysterious tomes to gain power over the world of the dead. Necromancers are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Necromancers are able to raise the dead, commanding them to do their bidding and aid them in battle. A skeletal servant often accompanies the necromancer in her adventures throughout Norrath. Necromancers have mastered the powers of poison and disease, allowing them to assault their enemies with damaging afflictions that savage their vitality over time.<BR><BR>Necromancers learn to control and mimic the dead, allowing them to escape harm, convert their health to mana, and bend the minds of the undead to serve their cause. The power of shadow also is within the domain of the necromancer, with spells that bind and choke their enemies in darkness, hide the necromancer in a cloak of invisibility, and teleport through the shadows to escape danger.<BR><BR>Necromancers are a very self-sufficient class and often choose to adventure alone, though they can provide great value to a group as well. The necromancer is an excellent choice for the independent player who enjoys a wide variety of abilities.
3325 Paladins are holy warriors who use blessed spells and strength of arms to fight the evil and undead of Norrath. Paladins are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Paladins are able fighters and battlefield healers whose combat spells focus on stunning enemies and smiting undead. They also have several spells that increase the health and armor of their allies. Every so often, paladins can lay hands on themselves or their friends to instantly grant a powerful heal.<BR><BR>Paladins are the greatest force against undead. At higher levels they gain special abilities to smite these foes. Paladins also gain a limited ability to resurrect their fallen friends with lessened penalties for death.<BR><BR>Paladins can sometimes work alone, healing themselves with magic, but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. Players who like to engage in melee fights but want the options spells provide will find paladins a great class to play.
3326 Rangers are warriors attuned to the ways of nature, able to call upon the power of the wild to aid them in their fights. Rangers are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Rangers are scouts and hunters, able to track enemies from a great distance and engage them with deadly ranged attacks, but rangers can also fight well in a melee, using two weapons to attack their foes.<BR><BR>Rangers have spells drawn from nature. They can increase run speed and add to an ally's armor, health or ability to attack. In a pinch, they can heal or directly damage enemies with fiery attacks.<BR><BR>Rangers can hunt alone or in a group, though allies allow them to best use their abilities. A ranger's bow is a welcome addition to a group, adding a good deal of damage. The ranger is a great class for players who like to engage in melee battles between trips to explore the broad expanse of Norrath.
3327 Rogues are the stealthy thieves and vicious assassins that stalk the shadows of Norrath. Rogues are primarily a melee class, able to wear chain armor and use piercing, slashing and some blunt weapons.<BR><BR>Rogues are sneaky fighters who always seek to take advantage of enemies by attacking from behind. Rogues can backstab enemies for extra damage, using poisoned weapons for added effect. Rogues can detect traps, pick locks and pockets, and fall safely from great heights.<BR><BR>Rogues are known for their ability to sneak and hide. This allows them to move almost anywhere, exploring the dangers that lie ahead. Combined with rogue items that use illusions, rogues make excellent scouts.<BR><BR>Rogues are a specialist class that works best with a group of friends. Rogues can add greatly to the killing power of a group. The rogue is a good choice for players who like to do heavy damage while walking the dangerous edge of dungeon exploration.
3328 Shadowknights are unholy warriors who use fear, pain and disease to attack all that is good in the world. Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, able to wear plate armor and wield many kinds of weapons.<BR><BR>Shadowknights are deadly opponents who use evil spells to slow and cripple their enemies. They steal the strength and life from their victims, using this stolen power to strengthen themselves and their allies. When needed, shadowknights use their powerful harm touch ability to greatly damage their opponents.<BR><BR>Shadowknights can feign the appearance of death, fooling enemies into ignoring them. Combined with spells that degrade an enemy’s ability to fight, a shadowknight becomes a fearsome foe.<BR><BR>Shadowknights can use their dark powers to adventure solo for a time. The shadowknight’s lethal abilities are best used, however, with the support of a larger group. Players who like offensive melee fights but want a variety of ways to inflict harm on their opponents will enjoy playing a shadowknight.
3329 Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.<BR><BR>Shamanic magic has two main focuses--enhancing the mind and body of the shaman’s allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman’s enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman’s group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<BR><BR>The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman’s arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster’s attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<BR><BR>Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.
3330 Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<BR><BR>Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies’ attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<BR><BR>Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.
3331 Wizards dedicate their lives to learning the powers of fire, ice, and magic; channeling their knowledge into ever more destructive spells to unleash upon their enemies. Wizards are primarily a magic-using class, with the ability to wear cloth armor and wield blunt weapons and daggers.<BR><BR>Wizards are the most single-minded of spell casters, with the majority of their spells dedicated to delivering massive amounts of damage as rapidly as possible. To aid in their constant search for power, wizard have also perfected the art of teleportation--allowing them to instantly transport themselves and their allies to the most remote corners of Norrath and beyond.<BR><BR>Wizards are a tightly focused class, gaining the greatest ability to deal magical damage in exchange for limited variety in their spell selection. Wizards are capable adventurers both solo and in groups, and are an excellent choice for players who live to blow things up.
3332 Strength is one factor in determining how much damage you do with weapons and special attacks.  It directly affects the amount of weight you can carry before suffering penalties.  It also increases your chance to gain Offense and Bash skill points.<BR><BR>Tradeskills:  If your strength is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Blacksmithing.
3333 Stamina increases your maximum hitpoints.  Different classes get more hit points per point of stamina than others.  Stamina also determines your maximum air supply when you are underwater or in an airless zone.
3334 Agility is one factor in determining your avoidance--how often NPC’s will miss when trying to hit you.  It also increases your chances to gain points in some combat skills.
3335 Dexterity affects your chances for special melee abilities such as combat effects and critical hits.  It increases your chances to gain points in most combat skills.  It is also a factor in determining how much damage you do with throwing weapons and archery.<BR><BR>Bard Only:  High dexterity decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.<BR><BR>Tradeskills:  If your dexterity is higher than your intelligence or wisdom, it determines how quickly you gain skill in Fletching and Make Poison.
3336 Wisdom affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your intelligence.<BR><BR>Wisdom is the primary spell-casting attribute for Paladins, Rangers, Beastlords, Clerics, Shaman, and Druids.  If affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  It also determines how often a spell will fail to be cast correctly (fizzle).
3337 Intelligence affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your wisdom.<BR><BR>Intelligence is the primary spell-casting attribute for Shadowknights, Bards, Wizards, Enchanters, Necromancers, and Magicians.  It affects how much mana these classes have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest.  For all except bards, it also determines how often a spell will fail to cast correctly (fizzle).
3338 Charisma affects how much merchants will charge you for their wares.  It also affects the chances for charm, memory blur, mesmerization, and divine intervention spell effects to work.<BR><BR>Bard only:  High charisma decreases the chance you will miss a note while playing a song.
3339 While Gnomes are knee-high to some of the taller races, they make up for it with their cleverness and skills.  They are by no means a strong and sturdy race, but their edge is their dexterity and intelligence.  They were the second race, after Dwarves, created by Brell Serilis.  <BR><BR>Gnomes have an innate preoccupation and skill with gadgets.  They are a curious race that creates strange, but very useful items that enhance their lives.  Gnomes have created a number of fantastic machines, including an observatory which houses one of the most powerful telescopes in Norrath.  Even with all of their accomplishments, gnomes are rarely taken seriously because of their size and behavior.  <BR><BR>Gnomes are friendly with all good Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, and Humans.  Although they do not quite understand the Erudites, they will interact with them.  Gnomes have a general aversion to Trolls, Ogres, Teir`Dal, and other evil races, but don’t necessarily hate them.  <BR><BR>The clicking of gears and clacking of machinery fill the mechanized Gnome city of Ak’Anon that lies southeast of the Faydark, on the continent of Faydwer.  Ak’Anon sprawls out under the Steamfont Mountains.

4002 AGNOSTIC<BR><BR>Agnostics will not commit to a belief in the existence or non-existence of any deity.
4003 BERTOXXULOUS - THE PLAGUEBRINGER<BR><BR>Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on Norrath is that everything dies. They view the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate beauty.  The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost iridescent yellow/ green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the things that his followers relish. It is not surprising that many of his followers pursue the dark art of necromancy, for to them nothing is more desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in undeath, continue to rot and decay.  Do not take this to mean that his followers are suicidal or seek a quick death.  To the contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased stain across all Norrath.
4004 BRISTLEBANE - KING OF THIEVES<BR><BR>Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun at the expense of nearly all else.  Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers, and gypsies are all typical followers.  They are almost always very charming, clever, and witty: traits all his followers should strive to possess. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged.  Practical jokes are performed as if they were the highest rituals.  Very few of his followers are outright wicked in their desires, but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they are  about.  And never let one deal you a hand of King's Court.
4005 CAZIC-THULE - THE FACELESS<BR><BR>Followers of Cazic-Thule fear their Lord and believe that only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath.  They strive to beat down and suppress all hope.  Fear rules their lives and through fear they rule the lives of others.  Pain, misery, violence, torture, and living sacrifice are the tools of a Cazicite.  Many lizardman tribes are devout followers, but his number of humanoid patrons grows daily, a cold shadow slowly engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a twisted nightmare of horror and pain.
4006 INNORUUK - THE PRINCE OF HATE<BR><BR>Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire dark elven race, who regard Him as their 'Father'.  They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather 'THE' creative force in the universe.  Creativity is born of destruction.  Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain their ends.  It is only through the total disdain of one's enemies that one can gain true power over them.  Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest belief of his followers that if they were to hate strong enough, they could destroy all of Norrath.
4007 KARANA - THE RAINKEEPER<BR><BR>Followers of Karana believe in the absolute power of storms.  They worship the life giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane.  The followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer shelter from the elements to strangers.  Many Karana followers live a nomadic lifestyle, traveling where the winds take them.  They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.
4008 EROLLISI MARR - THE QUEEN OF LOVE<BR><BR>Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love conquers all.  It should be pointed out that while love is a generally peaceful concept, Erollisi's worshippers are not pacifists.  They would like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does not exist but they are not naive enough to think that Norrath is that world.  They have passionate loves of people, places, and ideals, and are more than willing to fight and die to preserve those things.  The dream of every follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they love.  Many paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow Erollisi Marr.
4009 MITHANIEL MARR - THE LIGHTBEARER<BR><BR>Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that valor is what separates civilized beings from beasts.  His followers live by a strict moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity.  They are champions of the downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in this never ending quest.  They will not rest until the day when all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. They take themselves and their duty very seriously, and have little patience for mischief or mayhem.  Many paladins are devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.
4010 RODCET NIFE - THE PRIME HEALER<BR><BR>Followers of Rodcet Nife take an oath to fight disease and death until one or the other finally claims them.  They are very generous and humble, asking little more from their beneficiaries than that they pass on the kindness to others.  They are not content to deal with the effects of disease and death after they occur and vigorously seek to destroy the sources of these evils. Healers and mystics are typical followers, but many noble rangers and paladins also have taken the Nife Oath.  They believe that through faith in the Prime Healer, the  wounded heart of the universe shall one day be mended, and death's dark shadow will never be seen again.
4011 PREXUS - THE OCEANLORD<BR><BR>Followers of the Oceanlord believe true power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's oceans.  They believe that eons ago, life first formed in the murky depths and that one day, the oceans shall rise again to embrace the faithful and consume those who are unworthy.  The Oceanlord's servants tend to live and work near, on, or beneath large bodies of water.  They seek to spread the word of Prexus to all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath against any who would cause them harm. Many sailors and fisherman are followers of Prexus.
4012 QUELLIOUS - THE TRANQUIL<BR><BR>Followers of the Tranquil seek peace.  They are not strict pacifists, however, and will fight to defend themselves and those they care about.  The peace they seek is an inner one.  They wish to know all there is to know about themselves and the world around them.  They thirst for the knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment.  It is through the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal peace can be obtained.  If every creature  fully understood itself and its neighbors, there would be no need for conflict or war. Followers of Quellious typically follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly questing for knowledge and hoping to find themselves along the way.
4013 SOLUSEK RO - THE BURNING PRINCE<BR><BR>Followers of Solusek Ro believe in the raw and unbridled power of fire.  Fire birthed the world and in fire shall it be consumed. True aggressive action is the only way for one to obtain what is desired.  Power is gained by superior force.  Followers of Ro have little fear.  They are bold and brash and say what they mean and do what they say. Social graces are something they neither possess nor desire. They demand the respect of their peers and more often than not, earn it as well.  Those who seek true elemental power follow Solusek Ro, and thus many wizards turn to his burning embrace.
4014 BRELL SERILIS - THE DUKE OF BELOW<BR><BR>Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a waste of space.  They find true happiness in the caves, caverns,  and tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath.  But this is one of the few points that all the followers of Brell Serilis can agree upon.  There are many different factions who all worship Brell.  The Runny Eye goblin clan claims that He is their father, much to the disgust of the dwarves of Kaladim, who know that the dwarves are the true children of Serilis. The vicious gnolls of Paw disagree entirely, for was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis can be found, in one form or another, nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.
4015 THE TRIBUNAL - THE SIX HAMMERS<BR><BR>Followers of The Tribunal seek one thing above all else: justice.  While some claim to express this desire by pursuing careers as guards or magistrates, true believers in the Tribunal do not recognize the rights of any court on Norrath and enforce the Tribunal's sense of ultimate justice on the rest of the population.  Retribution, vengeance, and punishment are sacred duties. Followers of the Tribunal are methodical, patient and just.  They must be so, for it is their belief that if they punish an innocent, the Tribunal will pass judgment  against them, and doom them to an eternity of endless torment.
4016 TUNARE - THE MOTHER OF ALL<BR><BR>Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's children.  The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which they believe to be a living and breathing being, to blossom and grow.  Followers believe that the world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth.  Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land,  followers are paying homage and respect to the Mother of their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for them.  Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature in all its forms.  Many druids, rangers, and a great many elves follow the ways of Tunare.
4017 VEESHAN - THE WURMQUEEN<BR><BR>Non-dragon followers of Veeshan believe that dragonkind is superior to all other forms of life.  They swear allegiance to the Mother of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or their loved ones to one of her children.  In return for this undying devotion, Veeshan is very protective and generous to her loyal followers.  Many humanoids have gained great riches and ancient knowledge through servitude to the wurms, but these gifts came with a high price...knowing that one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they can take your messy life whenever it suits them.  To most followers of Veeshan, however, serving a deity is its own reward.
4018 RALLOS ZEK - THE WARLORD<BR><BR>Followers of Rallos Zek believe in the survival of the strong and extinction of the weak.  The heat of battle is the only place enlightenment can be gained.  The universe was formed by conflict and in conflict it will end.  The victors will feast upon the remains of the fallen.  No respect or regard is given to the dead, for if they were worthy, their hearts would still pump blood through their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath.  Followers of Rallos Zek are almost exclusively warriors.

5778 Well met, soldier of Gukta. As a Warrior in the service of your god Mithaniel Marr, brawn and blood will be your greatest weapons, courage your lasting armor.  Know that those who follow Marr will look kindly on you and sometimes aid your efforts.  But beware.  The dark places of the world still hold many enemies.  Now go and find Dar Master Griblok.  He will begin you training in the way of the blade.
5779 Good tidings, wise one.  Though your god Mithaniel Marr now speaks clearly to other orders within Gukta, He whispered first through the spirits of the land.  As a Shaman, you listen still to His lasting words and to the other old voices.  The spirits will aid you when called, infusing allies with primal power while striking enemies with ancient wrath.  Use this power well, for the outcome of this age is far from certain.  Now go and find Yun Master Arglug.  There is much more you must learn.
5780 Peace to you, healer of Gukta.  As a Cleric, your life is forever dedicated to the service of your god Mithaniel Marr and his mortal aims.  Use your granted powers of healing and aid wisely.  Ease the suffering of the weak.  Tend the wounds of the strong.  For that is the secret of your power.  Now go, find Kor Master Gloorg so that you training can begin in earnest.  May Mithaniel guide your way.
5781 Welcome, wizard.  Your dedication to the knife's edge path of the arcane is no trivial choice.  You are the master of awesome and terrible energies, an arcane destroyer.   But do not forget the guidance of Mithaniel Marr.  He watches still.  Harness your purpose with the same dedication you tamed the wild energies of magic.  Now seek out Jin Master Sergug.  He will hone your skills.
5782 Our Lord's favor to you, sir knight.  You are the chosen of Mithaniel Marr, a Paladin, a blessed soldier in His eternal army.  You are a shining light in a world shrouded by evil.  Strike down all who would oppose your lord.  Smite any that seek to corrupt or defile His purpose.  Show only the mercy of your blade.  But first, find Shin Master Grubbus.  He will set you on the proper path.
5784 Only Frogloks may use this forge.

5797 You will become a strong fighter for the Berserkers of the Underfoot.  With Bristlebane as your god and inspiration, you will pursue mischief and the odd practical joke in your travels too.  As a stout and loyal dwarf, you will seek justice and fairness by the blade of your axe.  When there is a wrong, your might as a berserker will make it right.  In the great halls of Kaladim, you will learn much from your dwarven ancestors.  As a dwarf, you have a fondness for the barbarians, another strong and hardy race.  You will call many humans, gnomes, and halflings your friends.  However, when it comes to dark elves, trolls, ogres, iksar, and any evil race, it will make you burn with rage.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY

5799 In the cold and snowy Northlands, the formidable barbarian berserkers are charged with protecting their home city, Halas, and the surrounding lands of Everfrost.  As members of the Bloodrage Brawlers guild, young berserkers learn to master the rage that burns in their hearts and bodies and use it to overcome anyone who threatens them.  Barbarians feel superior to those with frail physiques, particularly Erudites and dark elves.  The Northmen are born with a hatred of ogres, trolls and other evil races.  However, barbarians feel a kinship with the dwarf race whom they view as their stout-hearted cousins. It is said that this fondness goes deeper than their mutual adoration of a good brew.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5800 Deep in the stone halls of the ogres' mountain home of Oggok, the Bonecutters guild raise and guide their young berserker members.  It is the duty of every ogre to learn to use their anger to charge their bodies and blades to defend their home and kin.  The Bonecutters see themselves as far more fierce and dangerous than the Craknek Warriors and Greenblood Knights.  They feel their gift with rage puts them above their brothers and sisters of the other guilds.  The Bonecutters berserkers feel they are the only ogres adequately equipped to protect and guard Oggok.  Walking the lands as an ogre can be treacherous, as most other races in Norrath will not welcome you.  For most ogres, this is acceptable as they have no great love for the good races.  Ogres also hate trolls and iksar, but will tolerate dark elves.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5801 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.  The Dethslashers trolls now fiercely protect each other -- though they may not always like each other -- and defend their most-recent home in Neriak's Foreign Quarter.  Be wary when traveling around Norrath as trolls are not loved by many races.  This dislike is returned by the trolls, too.  As you know, troll berserkers appear to hate everyone -- unless they are roasting on a spit or falling under a heavy axe. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5802 The proud and regal Vah Shir berserkers of the Ireheart Ragers guild welcome new members with open arms.  The Vah Shir spend many hours cultivating the talents of the berserker by helping them focus their inner rage to aid them in battle.  The Vah Shir berserkers are trained to have high endurance and their affinity for the spiritual world and nature allows them to quickly manage and focus their inner rage.  As a Vah Shir berserker, you will defend Shar Vahl and other Vah Shir with pride and determination.  When you are old and leave the moon, you will encounter many new and strange faces.  Most will welcome you.  Trolls, ogres, iksar, and dark elves will not. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5803 Nedaria's Landing
5804 There are some in Norrath that are born with an innate rage that, if controlled, can become a powerful weapon.  They are called berserkers.  The berserker is a master of the two-handed axe and of throwing weapons.  To keep their bodies light and swift, berserkers wear light chain armor.   <BR><BR>Berserkers are fearsome fighters that possess inordinate amounts of strength and bravery.  They lunge into battle swinging large two-handed axes or hurtling throwing weapons at their prey.  They carry huge axes because of the damage they deal and for the fear the weapons instill in the enemy.  As great as a berserker's skill with a two-handed axe is, his skill with throwing weapons cannot be overlooked.  As he becomes more powerful, he can infuse his rage into various thrown weapons, causing dire effects when they strike a foe. <BR><BR>With the mastery of his innate rage, the berserker also gains the ability to become "berserk" – a deadly state which causes a great amount of damage as a berserker's blade swings with frenzy.  As dangerous as berserkers are at these moments, they become more vulnerable to enemy attacks.    <BR><BR>Berserkers do not fear death and they value speed and agility over personal defense.  The berserker is at his best within a group of friends and adventurers that allow him to unleash his full anger on an enemy without interruption.  When standing within arm's reach of his enemy, the berserker is one of the masters of offense, crippling and maiming with impressive speed and skill.  And, in situations where an enemy must be fought at a distance, the berserker has the best throwing arm of any Norrathian.

It is the duty of every ogre to learn to use their anger to charge their bodies and blades to defend their home and kin.  The Bonecutters see themselves as far more fierce and dangerous than the Craknek Warriors and Greenblood Knights.  They feel their gift with rage puts them above their brothers and sisters of the other guilds.  The Bonecutters berserkers feel they are the only ogres adequately equipped to protect and guard Oggok.  Walking the lands as an ogre can be treacherous, as most other races in Norrath will not welcome you.  For most ogres, this is acceptable as they have no great love for the good races.  Ogres also hate trolls and iksar, but will tolerate dark elves.  @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5833 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  Those that worship Cazic Thule fear their god and avoid his wrath by instilling terror in others -- a task that is easy for a berserker with a mighty axe.  With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.  The Dethslashers trolls now fiercely protect each other -- though they may not always like each other -- and defend their most-recent home in Neriak's Foreign Quarter.  Be wary when traveling around Norrath as trolls are not loved by many races.  This dislike is returned by the trolls, too.  As you know, troll berserkers appear to hate everyone -- unless they are roasting on a spit or falling under a heavy axe. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
5834 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  Choosing Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, as a deity is not a bad choice for a berserker as disdain can fuel the rage deep within. With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.  The Dethslashers trolls now fiercely protect each other -- though they may not always like each other -- and defend their most-recent home in Neriak's Foreign Quarter.

5835 In the dark city of Neriak, troll berserkers train in the Dethslashers guild.  With Rallos Zek, the Warlord, as a god and inspiration, the berserker believes that the strong rule the weak and that victory, courage, and brute strength are paramount to success in life. With your inner anger, you will find that you can move your lumbering frame with impressive speed.  You will be protective of your own kind.  The Dethslashers trolls now fiercely protect each other -- though they may not always like each other -- and defend their most-recent home in Neriak's Foreign Quarter.
