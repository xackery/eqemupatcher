8001 You have about %1 MB of memory.  We recommend that you only select %2 detailed models to get the best graphics performance.  A lower polygon model will be used for those models not selected.  The Wood Elf is required if you wish to display any Elf, and the Human is required if you wish to display the Erudite.
8002 Engine settings:
8003 You have about %1 MB of memory.  These settings will allow you to tune the system for the best performance.
8004 Turning this off will prevent sounds from playing in game.  Recommend: ON
8005 Turning this option on will enable the social animations for the detailed models.  This options is very memory intensive.  Recommend: OFF
8006 Mip Mapping causes the world to blend together better but uses more memory.  Recommend: OFF
8007 Any light source carried by a player requires the effect to be calculated and drawn.  Turning this off will make the graphics faster.  Recommend: ON
8008 This improves load time on many systems, at the expense of using extra disk space.  The first time you load any zone or the character selection screen with caching on, it will take time to build the cache, after that load times should be reduced.  Changing your settings here will require new caches to be built the next time you play.  Recommend: OFF
8009 This option will save memory at the cost of a very slight reduction of texture quality.  Recommend: OFF
8010 This will set your preferred resolution for game play.
8011 The higher the quality of textures the better Norrath will look, but the more memory you will use.  Recommended: HIGH

In addition to the fees described above, if you are a resident of a European Union country, you will also be charged a VAT tax equal to 17.5% of the applicable fee).<BR><BR>The gods have returned and the mortal realm shifts with their influence. But a new presence walking among the gods - a malevolent force that was released into godhood by the follies of mortals. Unbound by the laws of the pantheon, it leaves corruption in its wake and threatens to bring the entire pantheon crumbling down. The only hope for Norrath hangs on the very mortals who have unleashed this upheaval. They may be the only ones with a chance of stopping it.<BR><BR>In Freeport, Druzzil has opened a portal within the Academy of Arcane Science to her home plane. The city, already strained politically, falls into chaos and power struggles as fanatics cry that the end is near.<BR><BR>Rallos Zek, learning of Druzzil's actions, resolves to guide Norrathians to the Plane of Rage. His daughter, Sullon Zek, the demigod of Rage, has been overtaken by the very rage she grants to mortals. Confined to a tower within her realm, she unleashes her fury upon her realm. Can intrepid mortals bring a balance to the chaos of her realm and restore Sullon?<BR><BR>The nature god Tunare, having lost her Chosen, has a growing sense of foreboding. She, too, has heard of Druzzil's efforts and now joins the fight against the threat. Her plan is bold but, as even Tunare herself admits, problematic. She intends to revive the ancient knowledge of her now-extinct first children, the Elddar elves. To do so, she calls upon Druzzil and Karana, the god of storms, for assistance. Karana sends great winds across the deserts of Ro to uncover the lost center of power of the Elddar elves, the palace of Takish-Hiz. Its walls and petrified gardens uncovered, Druzzil then manipulates time and space to provide Norrathians with passage into Takish-Hiz of Old, so they may learn from the most ancient race of elves and return that great knowledge to Norrath.<BR><BR>Though the gods have returned, time is short and the future of Norrath lies once again in the hands of mortals!<BR><BR><BR>
