Because Planar Progression can go off in different routes / zones, you may all ready have bits and pieces of Planar Progression. Because of that, you might not be able to figure out what to do next or what to do to 'fix' any flagging issues you have! This Guide should help you remedy this problem!

Go to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the Plane of Knowledge and say to her, "Unlock my memories." Do this a few times until the messages are consistent (this can potentially fix any flags). Then say 'Guided Meditation.' What Seer Mal Nae`Shi says are vague hints. Look thru the list of her comments below to find out what they mean (and thus, what you may have missed or may need to do).
<br><br>
The responses from Seer Mal Nae`Shi (below) are not listed in progressive sequence. Instead, they are listed in alphabetical order, starting with the first word of her response, to make them easier to find by simply scrolling down the list. The comment in parenthesis is what you may have missed or may need to do.
